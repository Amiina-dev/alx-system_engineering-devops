1. Show attached IPs
Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on.

Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-show_attached_IPs | cat -e
10.0.2.15$
127.0.0.1$
sylvain@ubuntu$
Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.

Note that we can see our localhost IP :)
