Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

-localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
-facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
-The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
^C
--- localhost ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.012/0.012/0.012/0.000 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping facebook.com
PING facebook.com (157.240.11.35) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from edge-star-mini-shv-02-lax3.facebook.com (157.240.11.35): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=15.4 ms
^C
--- facebook.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 15.432/15.432/15.432/0.000 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./0-change_your_home_IP
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.2): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.036 ms
^C
--- localhost ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1000ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.012/0.024/0.036/0.012 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping facebook.com
PING facebook.com (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from facebook.com (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=8.06 ms
^C
--- facebook.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 8.065/8.065/8.065/0.000 ms
In this example we can see that:

-before running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 and facebook.com resolves to 157.240.11.35
-after running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8
If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!
